Thinks to Consider:

1. Code templates.

2. Making good games.

3. Make a lot of ca$h money -- aka marketing.

4. To support user accounts? So people can level-up their characters or something.

5. Achievements?

6. Cross-game data (in terms of local user progress).

7. Cross-platform accomodations, specifically with dealing with various resolutions and aspect ratios.
  a) How to save artwork? vector or bitmap...does corona support vector?

Non-game App Ideas:

local user progress - A halfway between full-on internet-backed-up user accounts (which are a hassle with inputting passwords when you just want to play a quick game)
  Each instance of the app could store user accounts. These accounts aren't meant for much but perhaps visual customization and stat tracking. Simple but fun things to have.

Game Ideas:

twister - (details?)

leggers - each player controls a leg (literally) of a runner. Locally cooperative instead of competitive. Players can work together to complete the race quickly, OR this could be a networked game with 2 players on one device playing against another two on a different device, over the internet.
